## Is this website official? How is this different from the Program of Studies?

This site is unofficial. This site is maintained by APS's CS Teacher PLC. It does not have approval from the Office of Academics, the CTE office, or any administration. For official guidance, see the APS Program of Studies or contact the CTE Office. The official links to the Program of Studies and any other official standards are linked in each course description.

## Are students allowed to take courses in any sequence other than what it listed here? Should they?

The only official prerequisites are listed in the Program of Studies. The pathways suggested on this page are far more strict than those mentioned in the Program of Studies. 

To maintain the rigor in advanced classes, CS teachers will assume that students in each class have followed the sequences described on this page

CS teachers are very willing to accomodate students who have experience outside of our classes, are fast learners, and/or want to challenge themselves by taking advanced classes. We will provide one-on-one advice, and can provide resources to help students self-study if they choose to take other course sequences.

## Why does this site contradict the Program of Studies?

The Program of Studies is limited in its ability to represent the courses as they are presented in our schools. The Program of Studies matches the course descriptions provided by VDOE, and the courses in our schools do not always exactly match the VDOE courses. Most of our courses align with AP, IB, DE, or other certification exams and must present content beyond the VDOE description.

## How can I ask a question or propose an edit?

Reach out to any CS teacher in APS. If you aren't sure who, reach out to Chris Jones at ACC.
